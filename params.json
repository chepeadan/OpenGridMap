{"name":"OpenGridMap","tagline":"OpenGridMap: Corwdsourcing power grids","body":"![logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenGridMap_logo.png)\r\n### About\r\nWe are an open community that crowdsources realistic power grid data to be used for research purposes.\r\nHere you will find the tools for crowdsourcing power grid data. The goal is to create an open platform for inferring realistic power grids based on actual data. Our vision is to provide a tool to researchers and practitioners that is able to produce realistic input data for simulation studies. OpenGridMap will support the entire process from data collection to formatting grid data for various purposes. We explore innovative ways to capture data and produce power grid approximations, e.g., using smartphone apps, drones, expert classification, existing map APIs, and graph inference algorithms. **Join us and lets map the world's power grid!!!**\r\n@opengridmap\r\n  \r\n### How to help\r\n\r\n* Interested:\r\n+ Testing our App and giving feedback\r\n+ Crowdsourcing data\r\n\r\n* Researcher:\r\n+ Inference algorithms\r\n+ Contribute to development: github.com/opengridmap\r\n\r\n* Utility:\r\n+ Distribution grid data sets for comparison with our inference\r\n+ Rules and criteria used to design distribution grids \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor any inquiries please contact Jose (j.rivera@tum.de)\r\nThe project was started by the chair for applications and middleware systems of TU Munich and is supported by a German Federal Ministry of Education and Research grant (BMBF 01IS12057) and the Alexander von Humbolt Foundation. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
